## 🔍 Key Insights

### 1. Seasonal Performance Pattern (Previous System)

The previous system showed clear seasonal variation:
- **Peak Season (Summer):** 993 kWh/day
- **Low Season (Winter):** 372 kWh/day
- **Variation:** -62.5% from summer to winter

This is normal for South African solar systems due to:
- Sun angle changes
- Day length variation
- Cloud cover patterns

### 2. System Transition Period

**Nov 1-20, 2025:** Old Goodwe still logging data
**Nov 7-Dec 17, 2025:** New system fully operational
**Note:** Some data overlap during transition

### 3. Inverter Performance Issue

**goodweht1 is underperforming:**
- Capacity Factor: 30.6% vs 40.7% (best inverter)
- Performance Gap: 10.1%
- Contributing only 25.6% vs expected ~33%

**Possible Causes:**
- Panel shading issues
- Soiling/dirt accumulation
- Electrical connection problems
- Panel orientation suboptimal

**Recommendation:** Physical inspection required ⚠️

### 4. Load Distribution

**Previous System:**
- Fronius: 39.7%
- Goodwe: 60.3%
- Imbalance: 20.6 percentage points

**New System:**
- goodwegt1: 40.8%
- goodwegt2: 33.6%
- goodweht1: 25.6%
- More balanced, but goodweht1 underperforming

- **Frequency:** 1 reading per hour
- **Completeness:** 95%+ (excellent)
- **Sensors:** 2 (Fronius + Goodwe)

### New System Data
- **Format:** High-frequency raw data (power in kW)
- **Frequency:** 7-57 seconds (variable)
- **Completeness:** 99%+ (excellent)
- **Sensors:** 3 (all Goodwe inverters)

### Calculation Methods

**Previous System:**
```
Energy (kWh) = Sum of hourly power readings
(already in kWh per hour format)
```

**New System:**
```
Energy (kWh) = Σ(Power_kW × Time_interval_hours)
(trapezoidal integration)
```
