# Energy Intelligence Dashboard - Demo Script

## 🎯 30-Minute Stakeholder Demonstration

### Opening (5 minutes)
**Business Context:**
- "Before: Manual fuel tracking, estimated costs, scattered energy data"
- "After: Automated analytics, real pricing, unified platform"
- "ROI: Accurate budgeting, optimized operations, reduced manual effort"

### Live Demo (20 minutes)

#### Generator Analysis (8 minutes)
1. **Show Date Range Selection**

   - "Compare vs. estimates: Often 15-20% difference"

2. **Dual-Source Validation**
   - "Primary sensor: Cumulative consumption"
   - "Backup sensor: Tank level drops" 
   - "Cross-validation prevents data gaps"

3. **Real Pricing Integration**
   - "Not generic R22/L - uses actual purchase prices"
   - "Forward-fills from purchase dates"
   - "Monthly purchase tracking"

4. **Interactive Charts**

   - "Cost trends with real pricing"
   - "Zoom, filter, export capabilities"

#### Solar Performance (5 minutes)
1. **3-Inverter System**
   - "Combined GoodWe + Fronius output"
   - "Total generation vs. individual performance"
   - "System upgrade impact analysis"

2. **Production Insights**
   - "Daily generation patterns"
   - "Peak power identification"
   - "Hourly production optimization"

#### Factory Consumption (4 minutes)
1. **Meter Reading Processing**
   - "Handles meter resets automatically"
   - "Daily kWh consumption calculation"
   - "Operational efficiency tracking"

#### Billing Editor (3 minutes)
1. **Template Automation**
   - "Direct Excel editing interface"
   - "Automated date/unit calculations"
   - "Instant download capability"

### Validation Demo (5 minutes)
**Accuracy Proof:**
1. **Compare Manual vs. Dashboard**
   - Show January purchase records
   - Match dashboard totals
   - Demonstrate pricing accuracy

2. **Error Handling**
   - Show missing data graceful handling
   - Demonstrate sensor failure backup

3. **Cross-Validation**
   - Primary vs. backup sensor agreement
   - Purchase cost verification
