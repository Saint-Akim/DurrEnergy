## 🚨 Understanding Alerts

### Performance Alert Types

#### ⚠️ Underperformance Alert
**Trigger**: Inverter generating <70% of system average  
**Example**: "Inverter GT2 performing 8.5 kW avg vs 12.1 kW system avg"  
**Action**: Check inverter for shading, soiling, or technical issues

#### 🔔 Data Quality Alert
**Trigger**: Quality score drops below threshold  
**Example**: "Data completeness: 85.2% (< 90% threshold)"  
**Action**: Investigate data collection system, check sensors

#### 📊 Statistical Notice
**Trigger**: Insufficient data for reliable comparison  
**Example**: "Limited data may affect confidence in performance comparisons"  
**Action**: Continue monitoring, wait for more data

## 🏆 Industry Benchmarking Explained

### South African Solar Standards

Your system is compared against these industry benchmarks:

| Performance Level | Capacity Factor | What it Means |
|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Excellent** | >28% | Top 10% of SA installations |
| **Good** | 22-28% | Above national average |
| **Average** | 18-22% | National average |
| **Poor** | <18% | Below average, needs attention |

#### Capacity Factor Calculation
```
Capacity Factor = (Actual Generation) / (Theoretical Maximum) × 100%
```

**Example**: If your 30kW system generates an average of 6.6kW continuously over a day:
```
Capacity Factor = 6.6kW / 30kW × 100% = 22%
```

### What Affects Your Ranking?
- **Geographic location** (solar resource availability)
- **System design** (panel orientation, tilt, shading)
- **Equipment quality** (inverter and panel efficiency)  
- **Maintenance** (cleaning, repairs, monitoring)
